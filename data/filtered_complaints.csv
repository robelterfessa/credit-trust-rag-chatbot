2025-06-06,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Credit card company isn't resolving a dispute about a purchase on your statement,"I filed a dispute with my bank, Truist, on my business credit card for services I had contracted and paid for that turned out to be fraudulent. My dispute case number was XXXX. I singed and paid this contract on XX/XX/XXXX. I found out this was fraudulent transaction in XXXX of XXXX and filed my dispute XX/XX/XXXX. Truist has since denied my dispute for no correct or apparent reason that is applicable to the reason I disputed the charge. This case involves over 400 others and has been escalated to the SEC, FTC, and FBI. This is the letter along with other supporting documents I sent to Truist : This letter outlines my formal dispute and request for chargeback regarding undelivered commercial trucking services I contracted through XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The dispute relates to payments made via XXXX, funded through Truist business credit card totaling {$12000.00}. Although funds were transmitted through XXXX, these payments were in no shape or form a gift. They were for contracted services that were misrepresented, only partially rendered, and ultimately abandoned. 
Please refer to the contract attached. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX 's recent notice claims banking and payment processing issues caused by their subcontractor, XXXX XXXX XXXX, constitute a Force Majeure event. Additionally, stating XXXX XXXX XXXX was never in possession of leased trucks as that was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( their subcontractor ). However, banking issues, subcontractor failures, and business partner defaults are normal business risks, not extraordinary Force Majeure events like natural disasters, wars, pandemics, or government shutdowns, etc. 
My contract is directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX. Their subcontractors ' failures do not absolve them of their direct obligations to me under the contract. Courts consistently hold that internal partner or vendor problems do not excuse nonperformance unless explicitly stated, which is not the case here. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX attempt to attribute blame to subcontractors ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) does not absolve them of liability. Under basic contract law principles, a company can not contract away its obligations by outsourcing to third parties. The risk of subcontractor nonperformance remains entirely with XXXX XXXX XXXX, who was directly responsible for fulfilling the services promised to me. 
Therefore, their failure to make the guaranteed weekly payments constitutes a breach of contract and fraud, not a valid Force Majeure event. I respectfully request that this dispute be resolved in my favor. 
This dispute involves a substantial business loss totaling {$12000.00} across my Truist business credit card, as well as an additional {$41000.00} related to other business cards being disputed and tied to undelivered services and mismanagement of funds. Totaling in {$52000.00} as stated in the contract. These funds were provided in exchange for the expectation of truck leasing, weekly operational income, insurance, driver coordination, and full commercial fleet management all outlined in the signed agreement. These services were never rendered in full, and operational updates and income deposits ceased without explanation. 
The inability to recover these funds would cause significant financial harm to my business and undermines trust in secure commercial use of Truist financial services.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,FL,33607,,Consent provided,Web,2025-06-06,Closed with explanation,Yes,,13938213,3363,520,"i filed a dispute with my bank, truist, on my business credit card for services i had contracted and paid for that turned out to be fraudulent. my dispute case number was xxxx. i singed and paid this contract on xxxxxxxx. i found out this was fraudulent transaction in xxxx of xxxx and filed my dispute xxxxxxxx. truist has since denied my dispute for no correct or apparent reason that is applicable to the reason i disputed the charge. this case involves over 400 others and has been escalated to the sec, ftc, and fbi. this is the letter along with other supporting documents i sent to truist  this letter outlines my formal dispute and request for chargeback regarding undelivered commercial trucking services i contracted through xxxx xxxx xxxx and xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx. the dispute relates to payments made via xxxx, funded through truist business credit card totaling 12000.00. although funds were transmitted through xxxx, these payments were in no shape or form a gift. they were for contracted services that were misrepresented, only partially rendered, and ultimately abandoned. please refer to the contract attached. xxxx xxxx xxxx s recent notice claims banking and payment processing issues caused by their subcontractor, xxxx xxxx xxxx, constitute a force majeure event. additionally, stating xxxx xxxx xxxx was never in possession of leased trucks as that was xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx  their subcontractor . however, banking issues, subcontractor failures, and business partner defaults are normal business risks, not extraordinary force majeure events like natural disasters, wars, pandemics, or government shutdowns, etc. my contract is directly with xxxx xxxx xxxx. their subcontractors  failures do not absolve them of their direct obligations to me under the contract. courts consistently hold that internal partner or vendor problems do not excuse nonperformance unless explicitly stated, which is not the case here. xxxx xxxx xxxx attempt to attribute blame to subcontractors  xxxx xxxx xxxx, xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx  does not absolve them of liability. under basic contract law principles, a company can not contract away its obligations by outsourcing to third parties. the risk of subcontractor nonperformance remains entirely with xxxx xxxx xxxx, who was directly responsible for fulfilling the services promised to me. therefore, their failure to make the guaranteed weekly payments constitutes a breach of contract and fraud, not a valid force majeure event. i respectfully request that this dispute be resolved in my favor. this dispute involves a substantial business loss totaling 12000.00 across my truist business credit card, as well as an additional 41000.00 related to other business cards being disputed and tied to undelivered services and mismanagement of funds. totaling in 52000.00 as stated in the contract. these funds were provided in exchange for the expectation of truck leasing, weekly operational income, insurance, driver coordination, and full commercial fleet management all outlined in the signed agreement. these services were never rendered in full, and operational updates and income deposits ceased without explanation. the inability to recover these funds would cause significant financial harm to my business and undermines trust in secure commercial use of truist financial services."

I also included fax of my XXXX  XXXX XXXX Credit Card Statement showing my NY gas station purchase to prove again that I was in NY during this out of country fraudulent credit card charge. I called the Fraud Investigator a few hours after I faxed and they will not confirm receipt of my fax document.

2. Failure to Ensure Accuracy : Under FCRA 607 ( b ), credit bureaus must ensure maximum accuracy in their reporting. Discrepancies in balances, high credit limits, open dates, and payment histories across bureaus indicate noncompliance. 
3. Failure to Investigate : Under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), credit bureaus must investigate disputes within 30 days. My disputes remain unresolved despite exceeding the legally mandated timeline.

I reviewed the Notices and Letters section of my Citi online account and confirmed that no prior notice was posted, mailed, or otherwise issued before the action was taken.

There was some kind of intricate scam going on at this time involving my credit card ending in XXXX. On XX/XX/year>, XX/XX/year>, and XX/XX/year>, I had received 3 separate deliveries from my local XXXX store. Each package contained a bag of balloons that I had not ordered. I was especially concerned about this because my name was clearly on each package as though I ordered it. I called XXXX 's customer service and the rep looked up my XXXX account and informed me that there were no such charges on my account. He could not explain why I received the packages and told me not to worry about it because no such orders were on my account. 
See attached photo for reference. 

During this same time, ( not sure if this had anything to do with the above ) I received XXXX small yellow packages from an unknown sender on different days. I only opened the first received package which was a letter that was very vague thanking me for a purchase but not indicating what the purchase was or from whom. I knew it was another scam and assumed it was connected to the XXXX balloons somehow. I think this scammer was hoping I would scan the "" QR '' code on the front of the package to try to figure out who it was from but I declined to do that to avoid going deeper into their scam. Again, I am not sure if this scam is connected to the XXXX scam or just a big coincidence. 
See attached 2 photos for reference.

I am reiterating, I did not make any of the above 3 XXXX purchases. 

On XX/XX/year>, I received a letter regarding Citicard Master Card 's investigation of my above disputes and they included the Merchant 's ( XXXX ) documentation which XXXX claim proves I made the transaction.

My account has a fraud notice that they added, as they've repeatedly added fraud alerts to only my Citibank Premier Card ( I have other citi cards that they don't treat this way ), yet they continue to charge me an Annual Fee for a card they won't let me use or cancel. 

Citibank issued a reference number by postal mail and voice mail. I am sorry I do not work for citibank and can not contact them on whatever schedule they may have due to my busy travel schedule. I called them at the earliest possible and they rejected the reference number they provided me. They told me it's not valid and that is the extent of assistance I was given. 

The agent refused to assist me. The agent refused to tell me if a new letter has been generated and sent to me with a new reference number. The agent refused to issue a new letter with a new reference number. The agent refused any possible way to resolve the issue. The agent refused to offer any sort of solution with a given timeline where I could hope to resolve the issue. The agent told me she is helping me by telling me to just wait and do nothing. I asked to speak with the agent 's manager or supervisor and the agent refused. There is no way to escalate this issue except via another CFPB complaint.

This is another insult and sign of Citibank 's complete incompetence since they should know full well you can not modify the address on a card with a fraud alert on it without first resolving the fraud alert. Citibank never fails to miss an opportunity to demonstrate their incompetence while treating their customers with hostility.

2025-06-11,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Other features, terms, or problems",Other problem,"I signed up with the security provider, XXXX, a few months back after a roaming salesperson approached me at my home. I had been in the market for a security system so, the timing was right. The salesperson told me that they were going door-to-door in our area and if we had agreed to post their sign in our yard, XXXX would provide the equipment for FREE and that I would only be responsible for the {$89.00} monitoring fee with them. I have paid this amount regularly with only a short lapse when my debit card expired XX/XX/XXXX. Once I received my new debit card, I immediately added it to my XXXX app so payments could continue. 

Fast forward a couple of months and I started receiving calls from a number I did not recognize almost daily or sometimes multiple times daily. I am not always in a position to answer the phone during the working day but, when I finally answered, I was told that I owed {$290.00} to a financing company called XXXX, whom opened a retail credit card, charged to {$4000.00} for the equipment I was told was free. I did not want another line of credit nor did I consent to financing. Had that been the deal, I would have outright refused the offer and located a different security company.

I have since tried contacting them to resolve this issue and to completely close whatever it was I was signed up. Each time Ive spoken with a representative, I was asked for either a ) my account number, which I do not have or b ) the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number. When I verify the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number, I am told that the number they have on file DOES NOT match. I spoke with a representative from XXXX  today, XX/XX/XXXX, and when I attempted to confirm the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number I was again told it DOES NOT match. The representative then asked me to scan or send a copy of my Social Security Card, which I outright denied. The representative then gave me a separate number to call to try and resolve or dispute. When I called that number, I was met with an automated prompt that asked, again, for either the last 4-digits of my Social Security Number OR my account number, which is completely unknown to me. At this point, XXXX  has also claimed to have placed a statement credit in the amount of {$190.00} however, they are still attempting to bill me that same amount PLUS additional late fees. As a result, my credit rating is taking a hit do a delinquent account that I can not access or was completely unknown to me. On XX/XX/XXXX I received an email notice that I had scheduled a payment of {$200.00}, which was also not authorized nor did I consent to autopay terms with XXXX. I expressly told them NO, that I did not consent to them utilizing my debit card for automatic payment, especially since I had no idea who they were or what was going on. My account was NOT debited in the amount of {$200.00} thankfully but apparently tacked on a bunch of late fees. Had it been true that they credited me {$190.00}, I would then, in theory have owed {$10.00} if this were an honest transaction - NOT {$300.00}, which is inclusive of the allegedly scheduled {$200.00} + late fees incurred. 

I utilize XXXX for additional monitoring and services and, after receiving a recent notice of delinquency alert from XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX, I reviewed the notice and found that XXXX  had marked my account open and CLOSED multiple times as well as delinquent. 

I spoke with XXXX today, XX/XX/XXXX, and they were able to provide my XXXX  account number.

Recently, I discovered three unauthorized transactions on my Prosper Credit Card account, totaling {$640.00}. The charges were as follows : {$340.00}, {$270.00}, and {$22.00}. Upon noticing these discrepancies, I immediately contacted Prosper Credit Card to report the issue, request a replacement card with different numbers, and initiate an investigation into the transactions. The representative assured me that a dispute had been opened and that I would receive a temporary credit while the situation was being investigated. 

However, it has now been over a month since my initial contact, and I have not received any meaningful updates regarding the status of the investigation. To make matters worse, when I called again to follow up, a different representative provided conflicting information about my case.

Every single time, I just get automatic and immediate declines by the system with no chance for any reconsideration or explanation. This seems like you just have a horrible practice of a system just declining applications for absolutely any arbitrary or insignificant reason, with a process that lacks transparency and support in every way. When I call, I'm treated so horribly each time- your employees, which sound like they're in the US/ not outsourced for the application status and recon departments, literally sound like they hate their jobs and are quasi-yelling, they talk over me, they don't listen, they just treat you like XXXX and make you feel like you mean nothing and you're just bothering them, without any efforts to look into the declines that are not my fault and are system generated. They speak with such a hostile and aggressive tone. Citi does not seem to care about existing relationships either which is surprising for a bank this size. Due to this consistently very poor client experience, I'm reconsidering the entire relationship with Citi on the banking side as well, which I've had for a while now.

Background : I have had an auto insurance policy with USAA for many years. My children, XXXX and XXXX, reside with me and drive vehicles that are owned and garaged at my residence. Despite this, USAA has repeatedly failed to handle the policy and coverage information appropriately. Heres a summary of the issues : Policy Coverage Confusion & Removal of Children : My children were previously listed on a policy under my spouse, XXXX XXXX. 
USAA just informed me that my children were removed from XXXX policy to be added to mine but refuses to provide any information since we have been separated in XXXX divorce court since XXXX. 
Until today, USAA claimed that they could not add my daughters to my account, even though they drive my vehicles and reside in my household.

Inability to Access or Share Information : USAA refuses to share any information from XXXX account with me, even though we are legally married.

There has been no formal declaration of divorce in our household.

USAAs records do not reflect any marital change, yet they altered the policy under XXXX account without my knowledge or consent. 

Lack of Documentation and Communication : Previous conversations with USAA regarding our marital status and coverage details have not been recorded in their system. 
USAA states they can not look into anyone elses account but continue to make changes that affect my policy and coverage based on XXXX account. 

Insurance Coverage for My Children : I was just told after speaking with USAA many times in the past about index number XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX Date Action Commenced that I would need to be transferred to a separation or divorce team for further assistance suddenly. 

Billing and Renewal Concerns : My auto insurance policy is scheduled to renew on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I will receive a prorated bill of {$780.00} in XXXX and {$780.00} in XXXX. 
I was informed I have six months to pay the premium, but the renewal cost may increase, now that USAA is allowing me to add my children to my auto insurance policy.. 



Request for Assistance : This mishandling has left me unsure of my childrens coverage status and vulnerable to financial liability. I request that the CFPB investigate the following : Why USAA refuses to recognize or document my attempts to clarify coverage and household membership.

Why changes were made under my spouses policy without mutual consent or communication.

Why my children were not being added to my auto policy despite living in my household and driving my vehicles.

I am concerned about the lack of transparency, accountability, and customer service from USAA regarding these matters. I request assistance in resolving this dispute and ensuring that my children are properly covered under my auto insurance policy. 



I am happy to provide ing records and correspondence for reference. Proof of insurance should be sent to XXXX as previously requested from USAA.

While the charge was initially authorized, I filed a dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, after learning the attorney was disbarred, never provided any billing records, and failed to deliver the services promised. The signed agreement required monthly billing, and I made multiple documented requests for an accounting of how my retainer was used. The merchant never provided any billing statement, invoice, or breakdown of charges. No policy stating the retainer was non-refundable was disclosed at the time of payment. After the dispute was submitted, the merchant attempted to retroactively declare the retainer non-refundable through a letter I never received by mail which also contained a crossed-out date and lacked any confirmed delivery. 

Citi opened the dispute, issued a provisional credit, and formally requested documentation from me, which I promptly provided including the signed contract, written statement, and supporting communications. After accepting and processing the dispute in full, Citi later reversed the credit, claiming the dispute was not timely. This reversal came without any documentation from the merchant, and without giving me an opportunity to respond or appeal. At no point did Citi indicate that a rebuttal had been submitted or reviewed. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, a Citi  representative XXXX XXXX, via live chat ) confirmed that my dispute had been referred for reopening under Case ID XXXX, showing the case was still active after the listed reversal date of XX/XX/XXXX. I was not made aware of the reversal until XX/XX/XXXX, when I received a Citi text alert. It had not appeared on my statement or balance before that date. Since I filed the dispute on XX/XX/XXXX, the timeline directly contradicts Citis explanation.

Citis handling of this matter including opening and accepting the dispute, then reversing it without a rebuttal, shifting explanations, ignoring the provided evidence, and cutting off written resolution violates the Fair Credit Billing Act.

2025-06-06,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"On XX/XX/year> I was approached by XXXX individuals in front of a XXXX XXXX  at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. XXXX of the individuals explained that his XXXX  had recently been XXXX  and he was asking for donations to help pay the XXXX  costs. I learned later that this is a common deceptive practice. The man and the other younger boys were wearing badges on lanyards ( which were apparently fake ) that indicated their fund raising was authorized by the XXXX of XXXX, the XXXX of XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX. He explained that he was only allowed to collect donations via credit card and asked me if I could donate {$5.00}. I agreed to donate {$5.00}. He entered {$5.00} into a handheld device, showed it to me his phone, which had a credit card scanner attached to it. I tapped my previous ( now cancelled ) card on the scanner after he showed me the amount {$5.00} on the screen. The XXXX younger men then attempted to distract me, and I looked away while the man apparently changed {$5.00} to {$5000.00} and attempted to process the charge more than once. XXXX of the boys had handed me a clipboard that showed a list of the other people who had supposedly donated and a pen that was not working. While trying to sign the document on the clipboard, the other older boy grabbed my phone from my hand and held it momentarily. It was in that moment that he was able to respond "" yes '' to a text from CitiBank. My phone then died when I took it back as it was very low on charge. The XXXX of them then hurried away down the sidewalk. I knew I was the vicitim of a crime. 

I suspected immediately that I was the victim of a credit card fraud or deceptive practices crime. But my phone was now off and needed a few minutes to recharge. 

When my phone was sufficiently charged ( about XXXX minutes later ) I received a call from the Citibank XXXX XXXX department. I spoke with someone ( did not get a name ) who told me that they recognized the charge as suspicious/fraudulent charge, that it would be declined, and I told that person that I never authorized any charges of {$5000.00} to XXXX  * XXXX XXXX XXXX I was assured by the Citibank representative would be declined and removed from my account. And, confidently, that I did not need to worry because my account was protected by Citicard XXXX XXXX. Since then I have spoken with several other Citicard and Citi XXXX XXXX department who have all assured me that I would not be responsible for the charges, which were entered as {$5000.00}, not the {$5.00} I agreed to donate for the XXXX  's XXXX  costs. 

What I find to be CitiBank 's fault is that after recognizing the first {$5000.00} as fraudulent and declining the charge, and recommending I immediately cancel the card, which I did within a few minutes of the fraudulent transaction ( s ), Citi then processed XXXX more identical charges and transferred them to a new account they setup for me after cancelling the card that was used at the time of the incident. In their most recent letter they mentioned that the XXXX  and XXXX  charges were processed by them during a period of "" security closure '' clearance, which was after the first charge was declined by CitiCard, and after the card presented at the time of the incident was cancelled. I received no notification from Citi of the XXXX and XXXX charges, but they themselves recognized the XXXX  charge of {$5000.00} was fraudulent and declined it. 

I have sent them numerous documents and have also engaged an attorney, XXXX XXXX to help me resolve this matter. I can provide all the documents to CFPB at your request. 

After CitiCard received the first communication from my attorney, which advised Citi to not contact me directly, they did call me directly anyway. 

Also, after the incident on XX/XX/XXXX, I had numerous calls and spoke with several representatives from CitiBank, who all told me I would not be held responsible for any of the XXXX {$5000.00} charges from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX on the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I have provided CFPB with several of the documents submitted as evidence that this was deceptive criminal practices, and that the first charge was declined by me on the phone and subsequently by CitiCards, within a few minutes of the incident, as I was in direct contact and received in person assistance from a Citicard representatives.

I believe your company has failed to comply with the requirements set forth by the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which mandates that all fees, charges, and important terms associated with a credit card application be fully disclosed and provided to the applicant prior to the submission of the application.\n\nSpecifically, I am deeply troubled by the following issues:\n\n    Failure to Provide Full Disclosure: I was not provided with a clear, upfront disclosure of the terms and fees associated with the credit card offer prior to submitting my application. Under TILA, I should have been presented with the relevant details, including any annual fees, interest rates, and charges, so that I could make an informed decision regarding whether or not to proceed with the application. However, these disclosures were not given in a timely or transparent manner, which I believe is a violation of my rights as a consumer.\n\n    Deceptive Practices: The violations stem from the copy you sent to me after with the fees already tacked on with out me prior deciding if i wanted or accept those terms of the XXXX annual fee charged immediately, (deceptions and lies)  Upon reviewing the terms after receiving my card, I discovered that the annual fee of XXXX was charged within the first five months of the cards issuance. This fee is nearly 30% of my credit limit, which is an excessive amount. Furthermore, I was not made aware of this fee upfront, and the vague response I received when I inquired about it suggests a deliberate omission of critical information. I believe these practices fall under a ""dark pattern"" of misleading tactics, which intentionally deceive the consumer and restrict their ability to make a fully informed decision.\n\n    High Interest Rates: The interest rate on the card is 36.00%, which is incredibly high and disproportionately increases the balance owed. This rate makes it nearly impossible to pay off the balance in a reasonable timeframe, thus trapping consumers in a cycle of debt. This type of practice is not only unethical but, in my opinion, predatory.\n\n    Unfair Fees and Charges: In addition to the annual fee, I have noticed several other fees being added to my account. I was not adequately informed about these fees prior to my application, nor was I given an opportunity to decline or question them.\n\nAs a consumer, I believe I have the right to receive full and truthful disclosures regarding the terms and fees associated with any credit product I consider. By omitting this information and using misleading tactics, your company has violated both my trust and my rights under the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nI request the following actions:\n\n    A full, detailed explanation of all fees, charges, and interest rates associated with this credit card.\n\n    A review of my account for potential violations of the Truth in Lending Act and a refund of any fees that were improperly charged without proper disclosure.\n\n    A reassessment of the terms of the credit card, including the high-interest rates and exorbitant annual fees, to ensure they comply with both federal regulations and ethical business practices.\n\nFailure to address these issues promptly and satisfactorily will leave me with no choice but to explore further legal action, including but not limited to, filing a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and seeking compensation in regarding  violations of the Truth in Lending Act.\n\nI trust that you will take this matter seriously and provide a prompt response.

On XX/XX/year>, I submitted a written dispute to Citi Bank contesting this error. This account is relatively new, and I have consistently made my monthly payments online in good faith. However, I have experienced repeated technical issues with Citis payment portalspecifically, a persistent syncing error that prevents the payment from processing properly despite multiple attempts. 

I relied on XXXX online payment system in good faith and expected it to function reliably.

During this call, the XXXX acknowledged other methods for making payments but made no effort to address the flaws in the online system or take responsibility for the system failure.

I recently discovered that my credit limit was decreased without any prior notice.

4. TILA - Section 1026.9 ( c ) : Creditors are required to notify consumers of significant changes to their credit card terms, including credit limit reductions, at least 45 days in advance. I did not receive any such notification, thus violating my rights under this statute.

I did not make any recent purchases on XXXX and I live in XXXX, OR and have never been to New York. I am the only person with access to my account and my password is secure. I was not notified of any breach of data or suspicious activity within XXXX. I called XXXX immediately after receiving the email notification to alert them that the charge was fraudulent. After speaking to the representative, they let me know all they could do for now was open an investigation on their end. After getting off the phone, I changed my password to my XXXX account and went on to my Barclay account, which is the credit card that was charged, and marked the transaction as fraudulent. The transaction was removed while they investigated the charge. On XX/XX/year> I was checking my account ( I check my accounts almost daily ) and noticed the charge was added back to my account. At this time, I didnt have any documents in my profile nor had I received any letters in the mail on an update with the investigation. I called Barclay to find out why the charge was added back. After some back and forth with the representative, I was told that because the email attached to the transaction matched the email they had on file, it was deemed as not fraudulent. It took them over 30 days to decide that it wasnt fraudulent based off the email. I asked if they even contacted the merchant ( XXXX ) directly as I had an open investigation with them as well and I was informed that they had not contacted the merchant and based their decision solely off the email. I requested it be reviewed again and that they contact the merchant directly. I would also like to note that I mentioned to them that I had not received any formal documentation as of that phone call detailing the result of their investigation. After getting off the phone, I received a notification that a document was ready to review in my account. It was the official document of their decision and it was back dated one day making it seem like they sent it to me the day before. I have screenshots to prove this.

'' The following morning I could not unlock the car with the remote key. I called and spoke to XXXX customer service and they pinged the vehicle and made me aware that the car battery was dead. They sent roadside assistance to jump it and we proceeded to the XXXX XXXX for our vacation. Upon arriving back to the car I could again not unlock it with the remote car key. I used the key to manually unlock the car so my family had somewhere to sit. XXXX customer service pinged the vehicle and notified me that the car battery was again dead. It was roughly XXXX in the evening and I requested for a new vehicle to be brought to me in exchange for the one I had. They made me aware that that service was not within their customer service emergency services guidelines. I was told I would have XXXX XXXX the car back to the airport to exchange the cars and they head back to my vacation spot. I then requested for XXXX to have their roadside assistance to replace the battery. They stated that they do not provide that service either.

My family underwent undue hardship and was stranded XXXX hours that night due to XXXX 's poor action plans for emergency services. 

Upon returning home I called XXXX with a request for a refund.

2025-03-31,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Trouble using your card,Can't use card to make purchases,"I am reaching out regarding an issue with my Chase Freedom Unlimited account that has caused significant financial distress.

While I was out of work and XXXX  for four months due to an XXXX, I fell behind on my bills. During this time, I contacted Chase to request temporary payment assistance, but I was informed that no payment plans were available. As a result, late fees and interest continued to accumulate, making it impossible for me to meet even the minimum payment. As a single mother with no child support, relying on food pantries, and struggling with basic living expenses, I could only prioritize rent and food with my XXXX checks. Around the holidays, I even required assistance from a friend to pay my utility bill. 

Upon returning to work, I contacted Chase to request the removal of late fees and interest charges so I could pay my balance in full and utilize my card again. My credit limit was {$4500.00}. While the late fees were waived, the interest charges remained. Before making a payment, I specifically asked two customer service representatives whether my credit limit would remain the same and whether my account would stay active. Both representatives assured me that my account would be brought up to date with no changes to my credit limit or access to using the card. They even congratulated me on my bigger payment. 

Based on this confirmation, I proceeded with a {$3000.00} payment. However, the very next day, my card was declined. When I checked my account, I discovered that Chase had turned my card OFF and reduced my credit limit from {$4500.00} to $ XXXX the assurances I received. This unexpected change has left me in an extremely difficult financial position. 

I trusted the information provided by the representatives, and the recorded calls will confirm these conversations. Had I been informed that my credit limit would be reduced, I would have reconsidered making such a large payment in one lump sum. Given the current economic conditions, rising costs of living, and my ongoing medical treatments, this decision has placed a significant burden on me as a consumer.

I respectfully request that my credit limit be reinstated or, at the very least, that I be provided with a resolution that allows me access to the funds I worked so hard to pay back!! I am asking Chase to honor the information given to me by their representatives. Please review the recorded calls for verification.

2025-05-21,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Problem with fees,"I experienced a XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  in early 2025, which caused me to miss payments on several credit cards. Once I was safe and able to take action, I logged into the Wells Fargo mobile app and chose to pay the full Total Balance displayed {$7700.00} on XX/XX/scrub>, 2025. The app also showed a smaller Statement Balance, but I intentionally chose the Total Balance so that all interest, penalties, and fees would be covered and the card brought to XXXX. 

Immediately after submitting that payment, the app showed a new charge of {$40.00}, but I was blocked from paying it. The app said I couldnt make another payment because one had just been processed. I had to wait a day before I was allowed to pay the {$40.00} which I did on XX/XX/year>2025. That again brought the balance to zero. 

A month later, Wells Fargo added another charge {$58.00} which they claimed was for interest and penalties related to the late payment. I contacted them to explain : I understood I had been late.

I deliberately paid the full Total Balance ( not the statement balance ) and then paid the unexpected {$40.00} as soon as the app allowed.

I was asking them to let me pay everything they claimed I owed, including any interest and late fees, to fully resolve and close the matter.

Instead of giving me a final payoff amount, they kept replying, But you paid it late, and refused to accept that I was repeatedly trying to pay everything off in full. I kept telling them I know its late but I should be able to pay everything I owe, interest and penalties on an account that has been closed for months instead of this engineered perpetual circular debt that can not be resolved and all they would say is but you paid it late in repetition and that "" interest and penalties will continue to accrue as long as you pay late, even though I kept paying the full amounts as soon as they were shown to me.

I was told "" but you paid late '' in repetition to me saying I know that but was attempting to pay everything I owed including late fees and interest so that no charges would occur again like they couldn't hear me or were trying to anger me and that interest and penalties will continue to accrue as long as you pay late, as if I wasnt trying to satisfy the account paying all fees, interest and principle without delay. I was paying the entire Total Balance as soon as a balance was shown, trying to resolve it completely. Despite my full payments each time a balance appeared, new charges would reappear, and I was again told, theyll keep occurring as long as you pay late. This made it impossible to escape the loop, despite my repeated efforts to bring the account to XXXX 

Other credit card companies I dealt with during this time simply allowed me to pay what I owed and closed the account. Wells Fargo was the only one that refused to accept full payment and kept the account in a fee loop. Today, after extensive back and forth, they finally told me they will allow me to pay the {$58.00} and bring the balance to XXXX  without adding more charges. I will monitor the account to confirm.

However, I still believe their behavior was intentional and exploitative.

Why Im filing this complaint : The app misrepresented Total Balance as a complete payoff, but allowed new charges immediately afterward and then continue to accrue fees.

I was blocked from paying the {$40.00} that appeared immediately after the full payment when I wanted to pay all fees.

Wells Fargo refused to provide a final payoff amount even after I paid in full and then again.

They told me interest and penalties would continue to accrue as long as I pay late, despite my efforts to pay the full balance and all charges each time they appeared.

They kept me in a billing loop while insisting on a vague explanation : you paid late.

2025-06-03,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Fees or interest,Charged too much interest,"For a US Bank State Farm credit card. Several issues : XXXX ) A promotion was taken out offering 0 % interest for a number of months. This promotion was paid back in full ; however, interest was charged on it for not just XXXX, but XXXX months after it was paid off. When I called, they said they had ended the promotional cycle early, and this information was listed in a "" statement '' which is DIFFERENT from the information you see when you log into online banking. The "" statements '' can not even be opened via the online banking ; they must be downloaded, which means they are impossible to open if you're on a shared computer or mobile device. This is VERY deceiving especially given they show DIFFERENT information than what is available when you log into the online banking website. 

XXXX ) To make up for the improperly charged interest, US Bank offered {$50.00} in rewards to be added to my rewards balance. This was supposed to appear on the following statement, which would be available XX/XX/XXXX. As of XX/XX/XXXX, it is not available. 

XXXX ) Interest was again charged for the balance that had been paid 2 months prior. When called, the representative claimed it was a late fee and it was invalid, and said there was nothing she could do to waive it and there was no one to transfer me to. 

XXXX ) The "" statement '' issue deserves to be mentioned as this is outrageous. When you log into the online banking website, it shows all your accounts and balances. The representative on the phone is claiming that the statements are different. However, these can only be downloaded onto a device ; they can not be accessed simply looking at them online. This is incredibly misleading and deceiving, especially when they apparently contain different information than what you can see by logging into your account to make payments. 

XXXX ) I called again and spoke with another representative who gave me no options for contesting charges or looking at these other statements.
